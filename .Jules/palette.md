## 2024-05-23 - Hardware Control Accessibility
**Learning:** Hardware controls (camera torch, zoom) are often overlooked in accessibility passes because developers test them visually. Icon-only buttons for these critical functions completely block screen reader users from using the core scanning feature.
**Action:** Always add dynamic `accessibilityLabel` (e.g., "Turn flash on/off") and `accessibilityState` to hardware toggles, and ensure zoom controls announce their purpose ("Zoom in/out") rather than just their icon name.
