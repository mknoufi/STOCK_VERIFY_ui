  "summary": "Final architecture clarification complete! Updated all documentation to reflect TRUE purpose: Stock verification + Data enrichment system. Staff not only count items but also correct/add missing data (serial numbers, MRP, HSN codes, barcodes, location, condition). Updated .cursorrules with comprehensive sync patterns, data enrichment workflows, and validation rules. Created DATA_ENRICHMENT_WORKFLOW.md detailing complete staff workflow, MongoDB schema for enriched data, validation patterns, bulk import capabilities, and enrichment analytics reports.",
  "current_status": "Project architecture now fully documented with THREE key purposes: (1) Verify inventory stock counts, (2) Correct incorrect item data, (3) Add missing values (serial#, MRP, HSN, barcode, location). MongoDB serves as enriched database storing both SQL Server reference data AND staff corrections/additions. System implements periodic sync for SQL qty changes, real-time checks on item selection, and comprehensive enrichment tracking. All enriched data stays in MongoDB with full audit trail. Ready for implementation with clear workflows for staff data entry, validation, and reporting."
