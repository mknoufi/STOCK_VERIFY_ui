  "summary": "Fixed blank page issue in frontend/app/staff/scan.tsx. The mobile version (non-web) was rendering an empty LinearGradient wrapper with no content. All UI content was only inside the web branch. Extracted and duplicated the content for the mobile version, wrapping it in LinearGradient instead of View. The mobile version now renders the same UI as web, including session modal, header (with BlurView on iOS, regular View on Android), scan button, item search, item display, quantity input, serial numbers, photo capture, and all modals.",
  "current_status": "Fixed blank page after session issue. The mobile version now properly renders all UI components. The app should display correctly on iOS devices after session initialization."
