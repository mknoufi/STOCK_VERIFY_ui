  "summary": "Ran test suite to verify system health. Fixed DatabaseHealthService initialization issue in server.py (uncommented sql_connector parameter). Frontend tests: All 49 tests passed (3 test suites). Backend tests: 142 tests collected, running with some failures in batch_operations and comprehensive test modules. System is mostly healthy with core functionality (auth, architecture, sync) passing. Some test failures appear to be related to mock setup in batch operations tests.",
  "current_status": "Test suite execution in progress. Frontend: ✅ All tests passing (49/49). Backend: ⚠️ Some test failures detected in batch_operations.py and comprehensive.py tests. Core functionality tests (auth, architecture, sync) are passing. Fixed critical initialization bug in DatabaseHealthService. Next steps: (1) Investigate batch_operations test failures (likely mock setup issues), (2) Review comprehensive test failures, (3) Verify all critical paths are covered by passing tests."
