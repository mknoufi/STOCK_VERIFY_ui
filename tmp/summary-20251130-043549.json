  "summary": "Fixed JSX syntax error in frontend/app/staff/scan.tsx. Removed an extra closing </View> tag at line 2446 that was causing 'Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag' error. The structure now correctly closes the View opened at line 2131 with a single closing tag at line 2445, followed by the ternary closing at line 2446. This resolves the bundling error.",
  "current_status": "JSX structure fixed. Removed extra closing View tag. Frontend should now bundle successfully. The Expo server should automatically reload with the fix. All compilation errors resolved: (1) searchState duplicate, (2) updateWorkflowState duplicate, (3) addSerialInput duplicate, (4) SystemStatus import path, (5) JSX adjacent elements. Next steps: (1) Verify app loads in iOS simulator, (2) Test scan functionality, (3) Monitor for any runtime errors."
