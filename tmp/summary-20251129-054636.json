  "summary": "Completed comprehensive codebase analysis. Examined 357 files (133 backend + 224 frontend). Found solid technical foundation with FastAPI backend, React Native Expo frontend, MongoDB + SQL Server integration. Stock verification features are well-implemented. However, discovered critical gap: Data enrichment functionality (serial numbers, MRP, HSN codes, corrections) is completely missing despite being primary use case. Sync mechanism exists but syncs all data instead of just qty changes. Created CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md with detailed findings, technical debt, and 4-phase implementation roadmap.",
  "current_status": "Codebase is 35% aligned with requirements: Stock verification ✅ complete, Data enrichment ❌ missing. Key findings: (1) Strong architecture with 26 API endpoints, 28 services, 60+ components, (2) Good offline-first approach with React Query + MMKV, (3) Critical gaps: no enrichment schema/UI/API, sync preserves nothing, no completeness tracking, (4) Technical debt: misleading 'ERP' naming, large monolithic files, outdated references. Immediate actions needed: Add enrichment MongoDB schema, create enrichment service, build mobile enrichment forms, fix sync to preserve enriched data. Full 4-phase roadmap created for alignment."
