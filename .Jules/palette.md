## 2024-05-23 - Hardware Control Accessibility
**Learning:** Hardware controls (camera torch, zoom) are often overlooked in accessibility passes because developers test them visually. Icon-only buttons for these critical functions completely block screen reader users from using the core scanning feature.
**Action:** Always add dynamic `accessibilityLabel` (e.g., "Turn flash on/off") and `accessibilityState` to hardware toggles, and ensure zoom controls announce their purpose ("Zoom in/out") rather than just their icon name.

## 2024-05-22 - Custom Switch Accessibility
**Learning:** Custom UI components like `Switch` often miss default accessibility behaviors found in native components (role, state, label).
**Action:** Always verify custom interactive components expose `accessibilityRole`, `accessibilityState`, `accessibilityLabel`, and `accessibilityHint` props.

## 2026-02-28 - Icon-Only Button Accessibility in Search
**Learning:** Icon-only action buttons (like scan barcode, voice search, and submit inputs) are completely inaccessible to screen reader users if missing proper accessibility props, as they provide no context about their function.
**Action:** Always add `accessibilityRole="button"` and an explicit `accessibilityLabel` (e.g., "Scan barcode with camera") to icon-only `TouchableOpacity` elements, along with `accessibilityState` for dynamic states like disabled or checked.

## 2024-10-08 - Floating Action Menu Accessibility
**Learning:** Transient custom UI overlays like speed dials and modals that act as dismiss triggers or multi-action menus must include explicit accessibility roles, labels, and states (like `expanded`) for screen readers to interpret their collapsible nature and allow safe dismissal.
**Action:** Always add `accessible={true}`, `accessibilityRole="button"`, and explicit `accessibilityLabel` to backdrop elements in overlay components, and ensure the main trigger conveys `accessibilityState={{ expanded: boolean }}`.
