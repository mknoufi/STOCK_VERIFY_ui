  "summary": "Successfully corrected and documented complete system architecture. Updated .cursorrules file to reflect actual architecture: Python backend (FastAPI/Flask) fetching from SQL Server (read-only) and storing in MongoDB (primary database). Created comprehensive deployment documentation for local network setup with three user types: Admin (main system with full control), Supervisors (web terminals for monitoring), and Staff (mobile/tablet apps for counting). Architecture now correctly shows one-way data flow with NO write-back to SQL Server or ERPNext integration.",
  "current_status": "Project now has accurate architecture documentation: (1) Corrected .cursorrules removing ERPNext/Frappe references, (2) ARCHITECTURE_CORRECTED.md detailing SQL Server → MongoDB one-way flow, (3) DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md showing local network topology with admin dashboard, supervisor terminals, and mobile staff devices. All documentation reflects actual deployment: standalone Python backend, MongoDB working database, no ERPNext, no export capabilities. Ready for local network deployment with proper user role separation."
