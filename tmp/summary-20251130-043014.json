  "summary": "Fixed two compilation errors: (1) Fixed SystemStatus import path in login.tsx - changed from relative path '../../components/SystemStatus' to alias path '@/components/SystemStatus'. (2) Removed duplicate updateWorkflowState declaration in scan.tsx - it's already provided by useWorkflowState() hook, so the manual declaration was removed. Both errors should now be resolved and the app should bundle successfully.",
  "current_status": "Both compilation errors fixed. SystemStatus import path corrected. Duplicate updateWorkflowState removed. Frontend should now bundle successfully for iOS. Expo server should automatically reload with the fixes. Next steps: (1) Verify app loads in iOS simulator, (2) Test login screen loads correctly, (3) Test scan functionality."
