  "summary": "Implemented critical fixes and upgrades: Refactored sync service complexity (reduced from 12 to <10), created comprehensive custom exception classes (10 exception types), added 10+ database performance indexes, and improved error handling across 4 services. All code compiles successfully. TypeScript strict mode already enabled. Remaining: batch processing optimization.",
  "current_status": "4/6 priority tasks completed. Code quality improved, database performance enhanced with new indexes, error handling significantly better with custom exceptions. Sync service refactored for better maintainability. Ready for testing and further optimizations."
