  "summary": "Fixed JSX parsing error in frontend/app/staff/scan.tsx. The issue was that ContainerComponent was conditionally set to either View or LinearGradient, but the closing tag was hardcoded as </LinearGradient>. Changed line 2748 to use </ContainerComponent> to match the opening tag. Also ran frontend linting and type checking to identify remaining issues. The critical JSX structure error is now resolved - linter only shows warnings and import resolution errors, not syntax errors.",
  "current_status": "JSX structure error fixed. ContainerComponent closing tag now matches opening tag. Frontend linting shows no critical syntax errors - only warnings and import resolution issues. The app should now bundle successfully. Remaining issues are: (1) Missing module imports (@/hooks/usePowerSaving, @/components/PowerSavingIndicator), (2) TypeScript type errors (implicit any types, missing properties), (3) ESLint warnings (unused variables, missing dependencies). Next steps: (1) Verify app bundles in iOS simulator, (2) Fix missing module imports if needed, (3) Address TypeScript errors for better type safety."
