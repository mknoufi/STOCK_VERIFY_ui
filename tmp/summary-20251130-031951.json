  "summary": "Completed comprehensive codebase study of STOCK_VERIFY_2 project. Analyzed backend (FastAPI/Python) and frontend (React Native/Expo) architecture, database integration patterns (MongoDB + SQL Server), authentication/authorization system, API structure, services, and configuration. Created detailed study summary documenting project structure, key components, design decisions, security features, and identified areas for improvement. The codebase is well-structured with strong security practices, comprehensive documentation, and follows modern best practices.",
  "current_status": "Codebase study complete. System is production-ready with MongoDB as primary database and optional SQL Server integration for ERPNext. Key findings: (1) Well-architected multi-database system with clear separation of concerns, (2) Strong security with Argon2/JWT/RBAC, (3) Offline-first mobile architecture, (4) Some sync services are currently disabled (needs investigation), (5) Comprehensive documentation exists. Next steps: Investigate disabled sync services, verify service initialization, test SQL Server integration."
