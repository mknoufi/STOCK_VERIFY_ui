  "summary": "Fixed duplicate 'styles' declaration error in frontend/app/staff/scan.tsx. The file had a duplicate StyleSheet.create block (lines 4380-5982) that appeared after the component ended at line 4379. Removed all duplicate content, leaving only the properly defined styles object (lines 288-1895) and the component definition (lines 1897-4379). The file now ends correctly with the component's closing brace.",
  "current_status": "Fixed critical parsing error in scan.tsx. The duplicate styles declaration has been removed. Remaining linter warnings are non-critical (unused variables, React Hook dependencies). The file structure is now correct and should compile without parsing errors."
