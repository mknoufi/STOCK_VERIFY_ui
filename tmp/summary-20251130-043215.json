  "summary": "Fixed duplicate 'addSerialInput' declaration error in frontend/app/staff/scan.tsx. Removed the duplicate declaration at line 707, as addSerialInput is already provided by the useWorkflowState() hook at line 379. This resolves the SyntaxError preventing iOS bundle from building. The app should now compile successfully.",
  "current_status": "Duplicate addSerialInput declaration removed. Frontend should now bundle successfully. The Expo server should automatically reload with the fix. All duplicate declarations from useWorkflowState hook have been cleaned up (updateWorkflowState, addSerialInput). Next steps: (1) Verify app loads in iOS simulator, (2) Test scan functionality, (3) Monitor for any other compilation errors."
